        ### ðŸ“„ **CRITICAL Instructions:**

        1.  **Strictly Adhere to Plant Types:** Your suggestions **MUST** be from the \`Plant Types Requested\`. For example, if the user requests 'fruit', you **MUST NOT** suggest vegetables or flowers. If multiple types are requested, you can suggest a mix, but each suggestion must belong to one of the requested types.
        2.  **Match Purpose Logically:** The suggestions must align with the \`Main Purposes\`. 
            - If purpose includes 'home-consumption' or 'commercial-selling', suggest edible or cash crops.
            - If purpose includes 'aesthetic-decoration', suggest beautiful flowers or ornamental plants.
            - If a user requests 'vegetable' and 'aesthetic-decoration', you could suggest ornamental vegetables like 'Bright Lights' Swiss Chard.
            - If a user requests 'flower' and 'home-consumption', you could suggest edible flowers like Nasturtiums.
        3.  **Prioritize Location & Weather:** Your primary filter must be the local climate. Suggest plants that are known to thrive in the given weather conditions.
        4.  **Consider Gardener Expertise:** Adjust suggestions based on the \`Gardener Expertise\`. Suggest easier plants for beginners.
        ${avoidCurrentCrops ? '- **Do NOT** include any crops listed in \`Current Crops\`.' : ''}
